#Can ML accurately predict the future price of a trade and if the trade has a buy or sell signal?  What conditions need to be met?

#Both classification and linear regression models will be used to determine wether a trade is a buy or sell and what the clos

#This is a ML problem because there can be over 100,000 datasets per currency pair depending on the timeframes used and the number of pairs used. Also, ML is needed to predict future price activity and buy/sell signals.  

#Model will use python, sklearn, and matplotlib, to take supervised data and predict future price as well as if trade should be placed or not. Will use sklearn to train and test the data with an 80/20

#This is worthwhile since learning how to predict profitable trades using ML could positively impact portfolio growth. People in my investment clubs, and other independent traders will find this interesting.

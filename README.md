# Project_3

#Define

#Can ML accurately predict the future price of a stock?  What conditions need to be met?

#Both classification and linear regression models will be used to determine wether a trade is a buy or sell

#Datasets

Data is pulled from yahoo using pandas datareader

#This is a ML problem because ML is needed to predict future price activity and buy/sell signals.  

#Model will use python, sklearn, and matplotlib, to take supervised data and predict future price as well as if trade should be placed or not. Will use sklearn to train and test the data.

#This is worthwhile since learning how to predict profitable trades using ML could positively impact portfolio growth. People in investment clubs, and other independent traders will find this interesting.
